Push a change to this file to trigger a build of our bots. For example,
change the haiku below.

A trigger haiku
Will cause the bots to re-run
To test all your stuff

Danish summer day
The rain comes down in torrents
WTF Denmark?

Danish winter day
Raindrops roll down my window
Same as in summer

Haiku Haiku ku
Hai Hai Haiku ku ku hai
Hai ai ai ku ai

Pub borked on Windows
Trying to get some data
Wish me luck, homie

Why won't the bots run?
Nothing seems to trigger them
Bet this'll do it

Status why you broke?
You make the bears very sad
Cry, little bear, cry

This time I'll fix it
I'll put it on my task list
"Bot not triggering"

Now we're running from
Dart dot googlesource dot com
So land this patch there
